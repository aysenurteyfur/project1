The project focuses on exploring global energy consumption trends by analyzing datasets from various continents. The datasets include information on energy consumption patterns, production statistics, and the usage of renewable and nonrenewable energy sources. The objective is to understand how energy usage has evolved over time within 2010 - 2022  across different continents and to identify which energy sources are becoming more prevalent
The dataset utilized for this project is the 'worldenergyconsumption.csv,' which contains data for 219 countries. It comprises 22,012 rows and 129 columns. The first four columns—'country,' 'year,' 'population,' and 'GDP’ serve to identify the countries and time periods. The remaining 125 columns capture various energy sources and their associated input/output statuses, detailing whether and how these energy sources are being utilized across different years. Each row corresponds to energy consumption data for a particular country and year. Our data filtering process began with cleaning the dataset to focus on the most relevant information and exclude unnecessary data. Although the dataset initially contained 129 columns, we only focused on eight distinct energy sources in order to answer our proposed questions. Many of the columns were variations or subcategories of the same energy source. Therefore, we excluded them from the data.
We systematically refined the dataset to analyze the energy usage of each country, and ultimately each continent, based on the eight selected energy sources. By filtering the data, we extracted the necessary statistical figures to create informative graphs and visuals. These visuals effectively highlight the primary energy consumption patterns for each continent. This approach enables us to clearly identify which energy sources are prevalent in each region, as well as to observe emerging or consistent trends across the 2010-2022 period.
In summary, oil has consistently remained the dominant energy source over the years. However, from 2010 to 2022, there has been a noticeable decline in coal usage as concerns over its environmental impact have grown. From 2010 to 2022, there has been a significant decline in coal usage due to increasing concerns about its environmental impact. Meanwhile, solar and wind energy have become more accessible, affordable, and cost-effective alternatives.
The adoption of solar and wind energy has seen a significant rise, reflecting a shift towards cleaner energy alternatives. This trend highlights a gradual but steady transition towards more sustainable energy sources. Looking ahead, renewable energy consumption is expected to strengthen further, driven by technological advancements and policy support. Meanwhile, oil is projected to maintain its steady presence, whereas coal consumption is likely to continue its downward trajectory.
